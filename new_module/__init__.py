MegaPythonLibrary (MPL) - Modular Architecture
==============================================

A complete, secure, and professional Python client for MEGA.nz cloud storage 
with advanced features, comprehensive exception handling, real-time synchronization, 
and enterprise-ready capabilities.

This modular version splits the functionality across 8 specialized modules
while maintaining full API compatibility with the original merged implementation.

Version: 2.5.0 Professional Edition (Modular)
Author: MegaPythonLibrary Team
Date: January 2025

Quick Start:
    >>> from new_module import MPLClient
    >>> client = MPLClient()
    >>> client.login("your_email@example.com", "your_password")
    >>> client.upload("local_file.txt", "/")
    >>> files = client.list("/")
    >>> client.logout()

Enhanced Usage:
    >>> from new_module import create_enhanced_client
    >>> client = create_enhanced_client(
    ...     max_requests_per_second=10.0,
    ...     max_upload_speed=1024*1024,  # 1MB/s
    ... )
"""

# For now, just export what we have until all modules are created
try:
    from .utils import *
except ImportError:
    pass

# Will be added as modules are created
# from .client import MPLClient, create_client, create_enhanced_client
# from .auth import (login, logout, register, verify_email, change_password, etc.)
# from .storage import (refresh_filesystem, list_folder, create_folder, etc.)
